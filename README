I originally developed this class in order to automate the job of downloading 
multiple email attachments. 

For my teaching assistant duties, when students send me source code to be tested 
and graded, I run Attachments with a specified file ending. In the case of programming 
assignmentent 2, the students' source code files will be called <username>p2.py, so I 
specify that only files containing the pattern 'p2.py' should be downloaded. I realize 
this surely isn't the most robust method for specifying which files should be downloaded, 
but it seems to work fine. The only probems I've encountered are when students do not 
stick to the file naming conventions.
